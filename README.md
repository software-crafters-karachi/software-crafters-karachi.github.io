## 3- Coding Katas?
Katas are a form of learning by practice. Katas allow us to experiment practices and techniques in a safe environment, so that we can later use them in the real-world.

We usually do our katas in pairs (or groups). Pair programming maximizes knowledge sharing, focus and quality of work. You can find more kata best practices & pair programming in our [Kata Guide](/kata-guide).
